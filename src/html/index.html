                Lisa Burrows is deeply rooted in the Eaton Community and Preble
                County. Her service to the area began in her younger years,
                under the mentorship of her father, Herb Gibson, the founder of
                Gibson Insurance, established in 1953. From a young age, Lisa
                embraced the values of hard work and putting customer needs at
                the forefront. A proud graduate of Eaton High School (Class of
                1983), Lisa embarked on a full-fledged career with Gibson
                Insurance in 1988. For over three decades, she has worked
                alongside Herb, who steered the business for an impressive 65
                years. In 2019, Lisa took the reins, becoming the lead agent for
                Gibson-Insurance, ensuring its continued success in the future.
                With a commitment spanning over 30 years to the community, Lisa
                represents the heart of Gibson-Insurance. Her extensive
                experience stands testament to the quality and dedication that
                clients can expect from a genuinely local agent.
